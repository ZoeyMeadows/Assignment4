Heya! This folder is my assignment for 3 assignments:

Game Asset Development: Assignment 4 & 5
Game Development: Assignment 4

How to play:

Click menu buttons to play, and press space to jump, then you suffer. That's the game.

This should work for all four, and I apologize for any inconviniences it may cause doing it like this, but this saves me the time of having to export three different parts of the same thing in three differnet places, which doesn't really make sense. Also it means Raph gets to enjoy a nice UI, and Tom gets to play flappy bird, so we all win here really.

Thanks for understanding
